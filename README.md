# ATM
My course design assignment last semester, **with many redundant code segments**.  
The program is divided into server and client.
It realizes local account management. You can use it to manage accounts, save money, withdraw money, transfer money and so on.  
Because I'm learning C++, ~~I'll rearrange this project one day~~.
